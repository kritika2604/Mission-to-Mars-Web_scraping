# Mission-to-Mars
Web scrapping 

## Purpose:
Robin, a freelance writer, while reading articles on space exploration especially mission to Mars decided that she would gather data about Mars from various sources and display in a central location in the form of a webpage, which she will use in her portfolio for her NASA interview. 

- Python script was used to navigate through the web pages to scrape and collect data,
- MongoDB (NoSQL database) was used to store the data,
- Flask framework was used to make a web application using python and coustomize it using HTML and CSS along with bootstraping.
